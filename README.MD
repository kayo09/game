# Theory
## WHY - 1
> Building a game means building a theory first. Theory for what? for fun. The purpose of this game is to be an **emulator to stress, health and senses**.

While envisioning something might be trivial, building it while preserving the vision is nearly an uneneding-game.

# Ideas:
- User is the creator (creator age is restricted to 0).
- Creator needs no tools at inception just ideas based on their calibre
- Cretor Judges calibre through Mathematics: geometry, numbers, words

## Current challenges: 
1. Implement an engine that dynamically produces required art:
   a. elements of art is based on geometry

### TO-DO
  * implement 24-bit colors for print 
    * e.g. 24-bit color is \e[38;2;r;g;b;m for foreground and \e[48;2;r;g;b;m for background, where r, g, and b are values from 0 to 255.
  * replace game/kind.json with a weights from a trained nn

    1. Choice creates Psyche which is just a tree <3
