Deep Breath
..
    Hi? How was your day? Did you drink enough water? Did you get a chance to eat something? Did you cook something? I hope you're not hungry. Do not ever be hungry please like starving hungry. 
    Ok, So there is nothing to write. Yet here I am. Just for the sake of it. Consistency can manifest as OCD. But I am in control. Also, FUCK MICROSOFT!!! They are a big scam, all of it (probably not azure). Scumbags have made a shitty authenticator, made a monopoly out of it, closed support and now you can't even recover your MICROSOFTaccount even when you have a recovery key. I am so angry at this corp. I swear it makes my blood pressure increase (among other things). Why do people in power don't understand/ don't care to understand the power heirarchy they create? Is power really so shit?
    Defy, Define, Delegate seems to the motto for people in power. First they'll tell you that you're not good enough. Then they will go out in the market looking for someone like you. Then they will oppress someone like you just cause they have some money, power or just something you need that they can exploit. I say kill 'em. We are humans remember? Make tools.. 
    No more supression. If you want to supress me, run a JCB over my body after I die. While I am living, I promise to fight back till my last breath. Mostly with my words. 
    Sorry, I am not inciting anything. I just do not want you to be a bitch to society. Be your own Bitch. BYOB. Stand up and debate why you think something is right! ok, bye, long-day today, only 2hrs of work done. Godspeed
